# Nicolas Project

## Overview

This project was designed with a focus on maintaining a well-structured and organized codebase. I employed various
strategies to separate the project's components into distinct folders to ensure clarity and maintainability.

## Project Structure

### Domain

I created a **Domain** layer that encapsulates the core business logic and entities of the project. This serves as the
foundation and is the most critical part of the application.

### Redux

To manage the application's state, I organized the state management into dedicated folders. This
separation facilitates better state management and allows for a more scalable application architecture.

## Challenges

One of the challenges I faced was learning and integrating **redux-observable**. This was my first time working with it,
and I had to quickly get up to speed with its concepts and implementation. Despite the time constraints, I was able to
develop the application to the best of my abilities.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I believe I could further refine and enhance the structure and functionality of the project. There is
always room for improvement, and I look forward to applying the lessons learned here in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project. It has been a valuable learning experience, and I appreciate the
chance to contribute.
